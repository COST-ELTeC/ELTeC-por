Contains ELTeC-por files at level 1 (richer TEI encoding)

When we started work in ELTeC, we had no idea there existed so few books in Portuguese from the period 1840-1920 in electronic form. To our dismay, we discovered that most digitization projects for Portuguese either concentrated on a limited number of canonical authors, or stopped digitization at the pdf level, or both. For non-canonical works, many texts had not even been scanned. We were assisted in this latter task by National Library of Portugal, but only until the pdf stage. For the vast majority of the works, the (Portuguese) COST team had to perform optical character recognition (OCR), which, due to the typographical and ortographical properties of the books in question and the lack of specific OCR software for Portuguese of the period in question, led to a huge amount of manual revision work.

The users of this material should thus be aware that most texts still need a finer-grained revision, and that some of the metadata is missing or unreliable. It will be incorporated and improved in a later release.

In addition, and due to the different sources of the material, the collection includes texts in different original ortographies, and in at least two different more modern ones, in the case of books obtained from (more) modern editions. This means that there are (and will be) widely differing ortographies in the collection as a whole.
