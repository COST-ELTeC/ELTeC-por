# ELTeC-por, level 2
Here are the Portuguese files parsed with the PALAVRAS parser v. 14008, from which we used tokenization, morphological tagging and named entity recognition.
Conversion to the specific COST level 2 encoding was done partially using the **visl2malt** converter included in the PALAVRAS distribution, and a set of COST specific scripts available in the script folder here.
