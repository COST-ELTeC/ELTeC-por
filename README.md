# ELTeC-por

This is the Portuguese novel collection for the ELTeC, the *European Literary Text Collection*, produced by the COST Action Distant Reading for European Literary History (CA16204, https://distant-reading.net).

## Release notes

* v0.9.0, November 2020: 100 novels, DOI: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4271644. 

General information about ELTeC releases is available at https://github.com/COST-ELTeC/ELTeC.

The users of the material should be aware that some texts still need a finer-grained revision, and that not all metadata has been reliably checked. 

In addition, due to the different sources of the material, the collection includes texts in different original ortographies, and in at least two different more modern ones, in the case of books obtained from (more) modern editions. 

## Contributors

The main responsibility for ELTeC-por lies with Diana Santos, who centralized the process and took care of the ELTeC encoding. Raquel Amaro established contact with the National Library of Portugal which secured OCR of so far undigitized works for ELTeC. Raquel Amaro also procured and got funding from Centro de Linguística da Universidade NOVA de Lisboa for the correction of OCR errors for the works, and hired Adeliana Silva for the revision. Isabel Araújo Branco hired Inês Lucas and Alina Balté for the revision. Diana Santos hired Vanda Morgado and Madalena Rato for the revision. Paulo Silva Pereira suggested several authors to be included and managed to get some hard to find works by woman writers.
